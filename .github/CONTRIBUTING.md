# Infotition Community Contributing Guide

The goal of this document is to create a contribution process that:
- Encourages new contributions.
- Encourages contributors to remain involved.
- Avoids unnecessary processes and bureaucracy whenever possible.
- Creates a transparent decision making process that makes it clear how contributors can be involved in decision making.

## Issues

Open an issue for any problem, suggestion or hint you might have. Even if you are unsure, don't hesitate to open an issue. Committers will always be polite and guide you through the process. We are thankful for every Thought.

If you have a question (for example about the code), please ask it in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/NpxrDGYDwV) instead of opening an issue because the **issue tracker is only for bug reports and enhancement suggestions**.

Committers may direct you to another repository, ask for additional clarifications and add appropritate header information to the issue before it gets addressed.

Please always be polite and respectful. Every participant is expected to follow the project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/DevTobias/infotition-landing-page/blob/main/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Contributions

Any change to resources in this repository must be through pull requests. This applies to all changes to documentation, code, text files, etc. Even long term committers must use pull requests.

No pull request can be merged without being reviewed.

For non-trivial contributions, pull requests should sit for at least 36 hours to ensure that contributors in other timezones have time to review. Consideration should also be given to weekends and other holiday periods to ensure active committers all have reasonable time to become involved in the discussion and review process if they wish.

The default for each contribution is that it is accepted once no committer has an objection.

In the case of an objection being raised in a pull request by another committer, all involved committers should seek to arrive at a consensus by way of addressing concerns being expressed by discussion, compromise on the proposed change, or withdrawal of the proposed change.

Check the [Collabortator Guide](https://github.com/DevTobias/infotition-landing-page/blob/main/.github/COLLABORATOR_GUIDE.md) if you want to contribute to the codebase.

## Becoming a Committer

All contributors who land a non-trivial contribution should be added as a committer, and be given write access to the repository.

Committers are expected to follow this policy and continue to send pull requests, go through proper review, and have other committers merge their pull requests.

If you wish to contribute to the Strivia codebase or documentation, feel free to fork the repository and submit a
pull request. We use ESLint to enforce a consistent coding style, so having that set up in your editor of choice
is a great boon to your development process.
